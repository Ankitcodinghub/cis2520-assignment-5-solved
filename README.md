Summary and Purpose

For this assignment, you will be writing a collection of C functions that operate on hash tables. You will use these to understand the underlying properties of hash tables, their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, you can compare the performance of the hash tables in this assignment to the arrays of Assignment 2, the lists of Assignment 3, and the trees of Assignment 4.

Deliverables

You will be submitting:

1) A file called hash.h that contains your function prototypes (see below).

2) A file called hash.c that contains your function definitions.

3) A makefile that contains the instructions to compile your code.

Structures for your assignment

You will be working with variables having the following structures which you must declare in your header file.

struct HashTable

{

unsigned int capacity; unsigned int nel; void **data;

int (*hash)( void *, int );

int (*compar)(const void *, const void *);

};

This structure represents a hash table (our fourth data structure used in this course). capacity is the number of elements in the table, and nel the number of elements currently in the table. data is an array of capacity number of pointers to the data accessed by the hash table. hash is a function pointer to the hashing function used to decide where to store the data. hash takes two arguments: a pointer to the data to be stored or searched, and an integer which is one more than the maximum value that the hash function is allowed to produce. Finally, compar is a function which returns a value of 0 if the data stored at the two pointer arguments match.

Additionally, you will be using the following structure to measure the performance of your code and count the number of memory read, memory write, malloc and free operations.

struct Performance

{ unsigned int reads; unsigned int writes; unsigned int mallocs; unsigned int frees;

};

Basic function prototypes and descriptions for your assignment

struct Performance *newPerformance();

This function will allocate sufficient memory for a Performance structure, set reads, writes, mallocs, and frees to zero (yes, I realize there is technically one malloc in this function) and return the address of the structure. Your function should print an error message to the standard error stream and exit if the malloc function fails.

struct HashTable *createTable( struct Performance *performance, unsigned int capacity, int (*hash)( void *, int ),

int (*compar)(const void *, const void *) );

(Allocate the memory for a HashTable and initialize the parameters.) This function will allocate sufficient memory for a HashTable structure, and copy over the values of capacity, hash, and compar. It will set nel to zero, and data to a newly allocated block of memory sufficiently large enough to store capacity many pointers. The function will set the value of each pointer in the data array equal to NULL, and increment the reads variable in the performance structure by capacity (one for each pointer). The address of the structure will be returned. mallocs in the performance structure should be incremented by 1. If either malloc fails it will print a message to the standard error and exit.

void addElement( struct Performance *performance, struct HashTable *table, void *src );

(Add an element to the HashTable with linear probing when a collision occurs.) If nel is equal to capacity, this function will print an error message to the standard error stream and exit. Otherwise, this function will pass the value of src and the value of capacity in the structure pointed to by table, and use the function hash in the structure pointed to by table to calculate an index in the pointer array data. Beginning at that index, it will increment the index until a NULL pointer is found (if the initial index is NULL, the index remains the same). If the index reaches capacity in table, it should be set to zero instead and the search for a NULL should continue. Each time it increments the index, reads in the performance structure should be incremented by 1. Once a NULL pointer is found (and thereâ€™s guaranteed to be one if nel&lt;capacity) at the current index in the array, it will copy the pointer value of src to the index in the array and increment nel. writes in the performance structure should (also) be incremented by 1.

int getIdx( struct Performance *performance, struct HashTable *table, void *src );

(Find an element in the HashTable, return its index.) This function will pass the value of src and the value of capacity in the structure pointed to by table, and use the function hash in the structure pointed to by table to calculate an index in the pointer array data. Beginning at that index, it will use the compar function in table to determine whether the src pointerâ€™s data matches the pointerâ€™s data at the current index within data until:

(a) there is a match (compar returns 0), in which case it will return the index; or

(b) the index reaches capacity, in which case it is set to 0 and the search continues; or

(c) it gets to the original index that was returned by the hash function, in which case it will return -1.

This function will increment reads in the performance structure for each time it uses the compar function.

void freeTable( struct Performance *performance, struct HashTable *table );

(Free the HashTable.) This function will free the data pointer in table and also free table itself. It will increment frees in the performance structure by 1.

Derived function prototypes and descriptions for your assignment

void *getElement( struct Performance *performance, struct HashTable *table, void *src );

(Find an element in the HashTable, return its pointer.) This function will return the pointer in the data array of the table at the index calculated by getIdx (above). If getIdx returns -1, it will return NULL. You will need to access table to implement this function.

void removeElement( struct Performance *performance, struct HashTable *table, void *target );

(Remove an element from the HashTable.) This function will set the pointer in the data array of the table at the index calculated by getIdx (above) equal to NULL. It will increment writes in the performance structure by 1. nel should be decreased by one.

The Last 20%

The above, constitutes 80% of the assignment. If you complete it, you can get a grade up to

80% (Good). The rest of the assignment is more challenging and will allow you to get a grade of 80-90% (Excellent) or 90-100% (Outstanding). Make sure you complete the first part well, before proceeding to the following additional part.

Write the following functions:

int hashAccuracy( struct HashTable *table );

(Compute the hash accuracy of the contents of the HashTable.) This function will calculate the difference between every entry in the HashTableâ€™s index and the value computed by the hash function. If the index is less than the hash functionâ€™s value, it will add the index to the difference between the hash functionâ€™s value and capacity.

void rehash( struct HashTable *table );

(Move the pointers in the HashTable to get a better hashAccuracy.) This function should move the pointers in the HashTable to improve the hashAccuracy. After running this function, the table must contain all the same pointers as before, just at different indices. Your grade for this part will be based on how much you improve upon the hashAccuracy.

You can write additional helper functions as necessary to make sure your code is modular, readable, and easy to modify.

Header File

Testing

You are responsible for testing your code to make sure that it works as required. The

CourseLink web-site will contain some test programs to get you started. However, we will use a different set of test programs to grade your code, so you need to make sure that your code performs according to the instructions above by writing more test code.

Your assignment will be tested on the standard SoCS Virtualbox VM

(http://socs.uoguelph.ca/SoCSVM.zip) which will be run using the Oracle Virtualbox software

(https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). If you are developing in a different environment, you will need to allow yourself enough time to test and debug your code on the target machine. We will NOT test your code on YOUR machine/environment.

Full instructions for using the SoCS Virtualbox VM can be found at: https://wiki.socs.uoguelph.ca/students/socsvm.

Makefile

You will create a makefile that supports the following targets:

all: this target should generate hash.o.

clean: this target should delete all .o files.

hash.o: this target should create the object file, hash.o, by compiling the hash.c file.

All compilations and linking must be done with the -Wall -pedantic -std=c99 flags and compile and link without any warnings or errors.

Git

Also, do your own work, do not hire someone to do the work for you.
